üöÄ OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
  ‚Ä¢ Install pytest-xdist for parallel test execution
  ‚Ä¢ Use pytest fixtures for common setup/teardown
  ‚Ä¢ Mock external dependencies to reduce I/O time
  ‚Ä¢ Consolidate similar tests to reduce duplication
  ‚Ä¢ Use pytest markers to categorize tests
  ‚Ä¢ Consider using pytest-benchmark for performance testing

‚öôÔ∏è CONFIGURATION SUGGESTIONS:
  ‚Ä¢ Add to pytest.ini:
    [pytest]
    addopts = -n auto --tb=short
    markers =
        slow: marks tests as slow
        integration: marks tests as integration tests
        unit: marks tests as unit tests

OPTIMIZED TEST CONFIGURATION
============================================================
# Optimized pytest configuration
[pytest]
addopts = -n auto --tb=short --strict-markers
testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py
python_classes = Test*
python_functions = test_*

markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    integration: marks tests as integration tests
    unit: marks tests as unit tests
    performance: marks tests as performance tests
    security: marks tests as security tests

# Parallel execution configuration
# Use: pytest -n auto (for automatic worker count)
# Use: pytest -n 4 (for 4 parallel workers)

# Coverage configuration
[tool:pytest]
addopts = --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# Performance testing
# Install: pip install pytest-benchmark
# Use: pytest --benchmark-only
